Position -  static - Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
          , relative - Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
          , fixed - An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.
          , absolute - positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (if any) or to the initial containing block.
          , sticky - positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor and containing block
